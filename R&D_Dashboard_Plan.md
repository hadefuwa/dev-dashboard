# R&D Dashboard Development Plan

## Project Overview

This document outlines the complete plan for building an R&D dashboard to manage project progress. The application will be built using Electron.js with a focus on simplicity and beginner-friendly code.

## What This Dashboard Will Do

1. **Project Management**: Create, edit, and organize R&D projects
2. **Progress Tracking**: Track milestones, deadlines, and completion status
3. **Team Management**: Assign team members to projects
4. **Reporting**: Generate simple progress reports
5. **Local Storage**: Everything saved locally (no internet needed)

## Dashboard Features

### Main Dashboard View
- Overview of all active projects
- Quick status indicators (On Track, Behind, At Risk)
- Recent activity feed
- Summary statistics

### Project Management
- Create new R&D projects
- Set project timelines and milestones
- Assign team members
- Track progress percentage
- Add notes and updates

### Progress Tracking
- Visual progress bars
- Milestone completion tracking
- Deadline alerts
- Status updates

### Simple Reporting
- Project completion rates
- Team productivity metrics
- Timeline adherence reports
- Export to simple formats (CSV, PDF)

## Technical Structure

### Frontend (Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- Clean, modern interface using basic HTML/CSS
- Simple JavaScript for interactivity
- No complex frameworks - just vanilla JS

### Backend (Electron Main Process)
- File system for data storage
- Simple JSON files for project data
- Local database using SQLite (embedded, no internet needed)

### Data Storage
- Projects stored as JSON files locally
- SQLite database for relationships
- Backup/export functionality

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

1. **Set up basic Electron app** - Main window, menu, basic structure
2. **Create project data models** - Define how projects are structured
3. **Build main dashboard** - Overview page with project cards
4. **Add project creation form** - Simple form to add new projects
5. **Implement progress tracking** - Milestones and status updates
6. **Create team management** - Add/remove team members
7. **Add local storage** - Save everything to local files
8. **Build reporting features** - Simple charts and export options
9. **Polish and test** - Make sure everything works smoothly

## Technologies We'll Use

- **Electron.js** - For the desktop app
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - For the interface (no complex frameworks)
- **SQLite** - For local data storage
- **Chart.js** - For simple progress charts (embedded library)
- **Simple CSS** - For styling (no complex CSS frameworks)

## Development Guidelines

### Code Philosophy
- **Simple and readable code** - Prioritize clarity over performance
- **Beginner-friendly** - Avoid advanced patterns and abstractions
- **No internet required** - All dependencies embedded locally
- **Open-source libraries only** - No proprietary or cloud-based solutions

### Implementation Approach
- Explain step by step before coding
- Confirm understanding before proceeding
- Write only simple, readable code
- Ensure all code is fully functional
- Provide full examples with imports and dependencies
- Avoid placeholders or incomplete code

## Data Models

### Project Structure
```json
{
  "id": "unique-project-id",
  "name": "Project Name",
  "description": "Project description",
  "startDate": "2024-01-01",
  "endDate": "2024-06-30",
  "status": "active|completed|paused",
  "progress": 75,
  "teamMembers": ["member1", "member2"],
  "milestones": [
    {
      "name": "Milestone 1",
      "dueDate": "2024-03-01",
      "completed": true
    }
  ],
  "notes": "Project notes and updates"
}
```

### Team Member Structure
```json
{
  "id": "member-id",
  "name": "Member Name",
  "email": "member@company.com",
  "role": "Developer|Manager|Researcher",
  "active": true
}
```

## User Interface Design

### Main Dashboard
- Grid layout of project cards
- Each card shows: project name, progress bar, status, team members
- Quick action buttons: Edit, View Details, Mark Complete
- Filter options: All Projects, Active, Completed, At Risk

### Project Form
- Simple form with clear labels
- Date pickers for start/end dates
- Dropdown for team member selection
- Text areas for description and notes
- Save/Cancel buttons

### Progress Tracking
- Visual progress bars
- Milestone checklist
- Status indicators with color coding
- Timeline view of project phases

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing** - Test individual functions
2. **Integration Testing** - Test data flow between components
3. **User Testing** - Ensure interface is intuitive
4. **Performance Testing** - Verify app runs smoothly
5. **Data Integrity Testing** - Ensure data is saved correctly

## Deployment Considerations

- Package as standalone executable
- Include all dependencies
- Create installer for easy distribution
- Provide user manual/documentation
- Include backup/restore functionality

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Project templates
- Advanced reporting with charts
- Email notifications for deadlines
- Integration with external tools
- Multi-user support with authentication
- Project collaboration features
